# Merriam-Webster Quiz 📚

An open-source alternative to Quizlet for practicing your word of the day.

---

## Introduction

I often struggle to retain my **word of the day**. As a computer science student, I created this project to apply my skills and help others facing the same challenge.

This is an **open-source React app** that lets you practice vocabulary using multiple-choice quizzes. Think of it as a free, community-built alternative to Quizlet or Merriam-Webster’s own quizzes — lightweight, customizable, and easy to contribute to.

## Features

* 🎯 Multiple-choice quizzes to test vocabulary
* 🔄 Synonyms and example sentences for better retention
* ⚡ Built with **React + TailwindCSS** (fast and responsive)
* 🌍 100% open-source and community-driven

⚠️ Note: The app doesn’t have a backend yet, so results aren’t saved. Some early months include **more words than just the daily list**, since my initial goal was slightly different.
